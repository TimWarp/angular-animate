angular-animate
===============

This is basically an improvement over "Angularjs: dirty animations with animate.css" which is available on http://nervgh.github.io/pages/angularjs-and-animatecss/. The animation does not work with AngularJs latest version like 1.2.x. I have tried to make it work for the latest version of AngularJs.
